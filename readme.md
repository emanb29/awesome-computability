## Compilation

About this section. Optional. Keep this short and focus on the list.

- [DOOM, compiled using only MOV instructions](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator/tree/master/validation/doom)
- [A C89 compiler which outputs only printable ASCII bytes, and whose binary is its own documentation](http://tom7.org/abc/)


## Turing Completeness

We distinguish "accidental" and "incidental" turing-completeness:
- Accidentally turing-complete systems are those which were not intended to be turing-complete, but turn out to be in a way close to their intended use. These are often associated with computability or computation.
- Incidentally turing-complete systems are those which can be "tricked" into being turing complete, unrelated to the intended use of the system. These are often games.

As a rule of thumb, "accidentally" turing-complete systems are _discovered_, while "incidentally" turing-complete systems are _invented_.

### Accidental
- [Intel Memory Management Unit (MMU) fault handler](https://github.com/jbangert/trapcc)
- [Border Gateway Protocol](https://vanbever.eu/pdfs/vanbever_turing_icnp_2013.pdf)

### Incidental
- [Magic: The Gathering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09828)
- [Minecraft](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/20219/is-minecraft-turing-complete)
- [Conway's Game of Life](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~welling/teaching/271fall09/Turing-Machine-Life.pdf)
