## Turing Completeness

We distinguish "accidental" and "incidental" turing-completeness:
- Accidentally turing-complete systems are those which were not intended to be turing-complete, but turn out to be in a way close to their intended use. These are often associated with computability or computation.
- Incidentally turing-complete systems are those which can be "tricked" into being turing complete, unrelated to the intended use of the system. These are often games.

As a rule of thumb, "accidentally" turing-complete systems are _discovered_, while "incidentally" turing-complete systems are _invented_.

### Accidental

These are systems that were discovered to be turing-complete.

### Incidental

These are systems that were "tricked" into turing-completeness.
